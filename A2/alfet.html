        <h1>Alfet </h1>

        <p>The Alfet was a form of trial by ordeal; the accused would stick their arm, up to the elbow in a cauldron
            filled with boiling water. </p>
        <p>The arm would then be bound for three days and the persons innocence would be determined based of if the
            wound was healing or infected.</p>
