    <h1>Final Project Information</h1>

    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <a href="Project Pitch.pdf">Powerpoint Link</a>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Im going to create a web based game critquing misonogy, homophobia and transphobia in the videogame
        industry/community. The game is going to be an rpg/narrative game. For the framework I'm going to using
        either phaser.js or p5.play</p>
    <h4>Reasearch Into the Project</h4>
    <p id="research">Video games have become a popular form of entertainment among young adults, but the industry has a long history of perpetuating sexist tropes. “In early games, females were put on a pedestal, considered pure and innocent, and needed the hero (a male, of course) to rescue them. In more modern games, this is rarely the case. The females are often the heroes of the game. They are sexy and often portrayed as a sexual object” (Summers, and Miller, 2014). This kind of representation is not good but has become the industry standard for women in video games as well as lgbt people. “The structure of the game industry and process of commercial game design tends to reproduce more problematic or marginalizing forms of representation” (Shaw, 2009 as cited in, Shaw, and Friesem 2016). This is also perpetuated by how cishet male dominated the game design industry; In a survey of 6436 game designers, 89.1% were male and 91.6% were straight (Shaw, 2009). This can also unsurprisingly lead to sexism and homophobia in the workplace, as well as for the consumer. “Female players are “continually humiliated, threatened, stalked, and sexually harassed during and after playing games.” 2 While the industry has finally begun acknowledging the issue to a certain extent, accountability is a separate matter that has gone mostly unchecked.” (Cho, 2022)</p>
